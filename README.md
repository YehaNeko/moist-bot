# moist bot
**moist-bot** is my personal discord bot with a bunch of random features.

# About code quality
This project has been my introduction to Python, GitHub, and programming itself.

The code quality varies from file to file, with many inconsistencies across the project.
If you are going to use this project as a reference, **I recommend looking at files with recent commits** as those are probably of the best quality.

Some background features of moist-bot have been copied or modified from [RoboDanny](https://github.com/Rapptz/RoboDanny) for ease of development. Credit is (hopefully) given where due.

# Inviting
This bot is not meant to be public and lacks the features to be so. An invitation link does not exist.

# Running
I don't want people running an instance of this bot, so I **will not** be showing you how to set it up or include the necessary steps and files to do so (such as `requirements.txt`).
